    "> The setup for the NDAIMM Main LPV computer program involves establishing a minimal coding environment essential for compiling its main computer application. This setup typically includes installing necessary compilers, libraries, and a version control system to manage the source code efficiently. Additionally, it's crucial to configure the development environment according to the specific requirements of the NDAIMM program to ensure compatibility and performance.\n",
