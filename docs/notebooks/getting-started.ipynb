    "> The setup for the NDAIMM Main LPV computer program involves establishing a minimal coding environment essential for compiling its main computer application. This setup typically includes installing necessary compilers, libraries, and a version control system to manage the source code efficiently. Additionally, it's crucial to configure the development environment according to the specific requirements of the NDAIMM program to ensure compatibility and performance.\n",

The framework of the repositories is there is a master repositories where all Notre Dame AIMM code gits are stored and within that are \"submodules\" which are further repositories out to other Github gits. The exact details aren't necessary to know at this point in time, so make sure you have git installed and check out the main repository:"

    "3) At this point in time you should see the submodules update and everything pulled in. Now a few things to note, when you commit from inside the submodule repository, lets say on nd-aimm-main-computer and push to external, that repository will update, but the main parent nd-aimm will not. There is a cron job on the CI/CD that will update the main repository once a day, but you can either manually add it via adding a push to the main branch in the nd-aimm directory, or simply pulling it down. The main repostiory does not need to updated often, as it serves as a way for everything to be in one place, not necessarily as a way to push to external."
